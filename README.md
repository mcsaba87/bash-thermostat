Bash-thermostat is a software implementation of a thermostat intended to be used in a family house using Philips HUE. 
The HUE motion sensor has a temperature sensor built in which can be accessed via the API. A switchable power socket
is wired into the furnace's thermostat connection in order to turn the heat on and off.
